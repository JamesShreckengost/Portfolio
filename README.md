# Portfolio
Portfolio for 301 pre-work
## Instructions
### Tell me about yourself
Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

A 2 or 3 word catchy title. Avoid cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.
A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?
Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.

### Gather your assets
A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:

A headshot of your lovely face, reduced to 100x100 pixels
A banner of you looking happy, cropped to exactly 1400 × 422 pixels
A screenshot of the best-looking part of your favorite previous project, like your Code 201 final project
Two or three other nice-looking screenshots, of any other projects you have worked on. Salmon Cookies? Bus Mall?

### Submission
Once you have access to Canvas for your course, submit your responses to the items listed above. Include direct URLs for the images you want to use on your page.
